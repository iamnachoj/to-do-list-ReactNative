# to-do-list-ReactNative
 My first practice proyect done with React Native: a great, performant todo list app that allows to add and remove tasks.
 
## Tools
 - NodeJS
 - React Native
 - Expo


## Getting Started
The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

### clone the repository
`git clone https://github.com/iamnachoj/to-do-list-ReactNative`
### Change directory
`cd to-do-list-ReactNative`
### Install NPM dependencies
``` npm install ```
### run the app
`expo start`

Note: It is recommended to install Android Studio or use Xcode for livereloading - It watches for any changes in your device app and automatically restarts the server.

## Deployment
Deployment to Android Studio or iOS.
